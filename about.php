                        Hello! I am currently a 2nd year student at University of Brighton studying Digital Game Design and I am hailing from Norway. I am very glad you would like to look at my portfolio today.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I have always been captivated by video games as early as 2006. At the start it was a lot of Ty 2 the tasmanian tiger or Top Spin, but quickly enough I got interested in history and the Assassin`s Creed series, Red Dead Redemption and Computer games like Imperator Rome, Civilization 5 - 6 or Europa Universalis 4.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Other interests are history, Vikings, cars, hiking and Land Rovers.
